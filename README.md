# experiments
Repository where I put experiments and projects I only needed one time. 

## Purpose
So I use this repository basically as an archive for all things that don't deserver their own repository.
E.g a hello world program in Assembly isn't getting it's own repository, it's getting dumped in this repository,
as the name suggests it's for experiments. Also projects that I only use once and won't maintain get dropped in here.
